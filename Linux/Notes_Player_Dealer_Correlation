Based on the logs investigation, Mylie Schmidt was playing 13 times when the losses occurred.
The dealer during the losses was Billie Jones and he was recorded 13 times as well when the loss occurred during the same times.
We can therefore conclude that Mylie Schmidt and Billie Jones were the ones colluding to scam Lucky Duck since they are on the same game at the same time when the losses occurred.
